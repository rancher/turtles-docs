== What is Rancher Turtles?

The Cluster API Extension for Rancher, also known as {product_name}, is a Kubernetes Operator that provides **integration between Rancher Manager and Cluster API (CAPI)** with the aim of bringing full CAPI support to Rancher.

With {product_name}, you can:

* **Automatically import CAPI clusters into Rancher**, by installing the Rancher Cluster Agent in CAPI provisioned clusters.
* Implement a **GitOps-native** workflow to managing Kubernetes clusters in Rancher.
* **Simplified management of CAPI Providers** using the CAPI Operator.
