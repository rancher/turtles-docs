= Installing the CoreProvider using CAPIProvider resource
:sidebar_position: 4

This section describes how to install the `CoreProvider` via `CAPIProvider`, which is responsible for managing the Cluster API CRDs and the Cluster API controller.

[NOTE]
====
Please refer to installing Core Provider https://cluster-api-operator.sigs.k8s.io/03_topics/03_basic-cluster-api-provider-installation/01_installing-core-provider#installing-the-coreprovider[section] in CAPI Operator docs for additional details on raw `CoreProvider` resource installation.

Only one CoreProvider can be installed at the same time on a single cluster.
