= Certified CAPI Providers

Remember that most Cluster API Providers are upstream projects maintained by the Kubernetes open-source community.

This is a list of the officially certified CAPI Providers by Turtles. These providers are covered by our test suite and we actively ensure that they work properly with the CAPI extension for Rancher.

== ClusterClass Support for Certified Providers

The following is a support matrix for each certified provider and their support of the cluster topology feature:

[tabs]
======
CAPZ::
+
- **Full support** of `ClusterClass`: both managed (AKS) and unmanaged (virtual machines) clusters can be provisioned via topology.

CAPA::
+
- **Supports** `ClusterClass` when provisioning unmanaged (EC2-based) clusters.
- **Does not support** `ClusterClass` when provisioning managed (EKS) clusters: this is a work-in-progress.

CAPRKE2::
+
- **Full support** of `ClusterClass`.

CABPK::
+
- **Full support** of `ClusterClass`.

CAPV::
+
- **Full support** of `ClusterClass`.

CAPD::
