[NOTE]
====
Currently {product_name} only supports having Rancher Manager and
{product_name} running in the same cluster. A topology with a separate Rancher
Manager cluster and one/multiple CAPI management cluster/s will be supported in
future releases.

== Rancher Manager & CAPI Management Combined

In this topology, both Rancher Manager and {product_name} are deployed to the
same Kubernetes cluster, and it acts as a centralized management cluster.

This architecture offers a simplified deployment of components and provides a
single view of all clusters. On the flip side, it's important to consider that
the number of clusters that can be managed effectively by Cluster API (CAPI) is
limited by the resources available within the single management cluster.
