Below is a visual representation of the architecture components of Rancher
Turtles. This diagram illustrates the key elements and their relationships
within the {product_name} system. Understanding these components is essential
for gaining insights into how Rancher leverages Cluster API (CAPI) for cluster
management.

== Rancher Manager

This is the core component of Rancher and users can leverage the existing
Explorer feature in the dashboard to access cluster workload details.

== Rancher Cluster Agent

The agent is deployed within child clusters, enabling Rancher to import and
establish a connection with these clusters. This connection allows Rancher to
manage the child clusters effectively from within its platform.

== {product_name} - Rancher CAPI Extension

It provides integration between CAPI and Rancher while currently supporting the
following functionalities:

* *Importing CAPI clusters into Rancher:* installing Rancher Cluster Agent in
CAPI provisioned clusters.
* *CAPI Operator Configuration:* Configuration support for the CAPI Operator.
