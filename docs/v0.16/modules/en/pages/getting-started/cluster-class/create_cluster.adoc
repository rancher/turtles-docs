= Create a cluster using Fleet
:sidebar_position: 2

This section will guide you through creating a cluster that utilizes ClusterClass using a GitOps workflow with Fleet.

[NOTE]
====
This guide uses the https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-turtles-fleet-example/tree/clusterclass[examples repository].
====


== Prerequisites

* Rancher Manager cluster with {product_name} installed
* Cluster API providers installed for your scenario - we'll be using the Docker infrastructure and Kubeadm bootstrap/control plane providers in these instructions - see https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/user/quick-start.html#initialization-for-common-providers[Initialization for common providers]
* The *ClusterClass* feature enabled - see xref:./intro.adoc[the introduction]

== Configure Rancher Manager

The clusterclass and cluster definitions will be imported into the Rancher Manager cluster (which is also acting as a Cluster API management cluster) using the *Continuous Delivery* feature (which uses Fleet).

The guide will apply the manifests using a 2-step process. However, this isn't required and they could be combined into one step.

There are 2 options to provide the configuration. The first is using the Rancher Manager UI and the second is by applying some YAML to your cluster. Both are covered below.

=== Import ClusterClass Definitions

==== Using the Rancher Manager UI

. Go to Rancher Manager
. Select *Continuos Delivery* from the menu:
. Select *fleet-local* as the namespace from the top right
. Select *Git Repos* from the sidebar
. Click *Add Repository*
. Enter *classes* as the name
. Get the *HTTPS* clone URL from your git repo
. Add the URL into the *Repository URL* field
. Change the branch name to *clusterclass*
. Click *Add Path*
. Enter `/classes`
. Click *Next*
. Click *Create*
. Click on the *clusters* name
. Watch the resources become ready

=== Using kubectl

. Get the *HTTPS* clone URL from your git repo
. Create a new file called *repo.yaml*
. Add the following contents to the new file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: fleet.cattle.io/v1alpha1
kind: GitRepo
metadata:
  name: classes
  namespace: fleet-local
spec:
  branch: clusterclass
  repo: https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-turtles-fleet-example.git
  paths:
    - /classes
  targets: []
----
+
. Apply the file to the Rancher Manager cluster using *kubectl*:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f repo.yaml
----
+
. Go to Rancher Manager
. Select *Continuos Delivery* from the side bar
. Select *fleet-local* as the namespace from the top right
. Select *Git Repos* from the sidebar
. Click on the *clusters* name
. Watch the resources become ready
. Select *Cluster Management* from the menu
. Check your cluster has been imported

=== Import Cluster Definitions

Now the classes have been imported its possible to use them with cluster definitions.
