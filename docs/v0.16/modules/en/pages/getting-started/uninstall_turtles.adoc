= Uninstall {product_name}
:sidebar_position: 5

This gives an overview of {product_name} uninstallation process.

[CAUTION]
====
When installing {product_name} in your Rancher environment, by default, {product_name} enables the Cluster API Operator cleanup. This includes cleaning up Cluster API Operator specific webhooks and deployments that otherwise cause issues with Rancher provisioning.

To simplify uninstalling {product_name} (via Rancher Manager or helm command), the official {product_name} Helm chart includes a `post-delete` hook that applies these changes, making it transparent to the end user:

* Delete the `mutating-webhook-configuration` and `validating-webhook-configuration` webhooks that are no longer needed.
* Delete the CAPI `deployments` that are no longer needed.
====


To uninstall the {product_name} Extension use the following helm command:

[source,bash]
----
helm uninstall -n rancher-turtles-system rancher-turtles --cascade foreground --wait
----

This may take a few minutes to complete.

[NOTE]
====
Remember that, if you use a different name for the installation or a different namespace, you may need to customize the command for your specific configuration.
====


Once uninstalled, Rancher's `embedded-cluster-api` feature must be re-enabled:

. Create a `feature.yaml` file, with `embedded-cluster-api` set to true:
+
.feature.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: management.cattle.io/v3
kind: Feature
metadata:
  name: embedded-cluster-api
spec:
  value: true
----
+
. Use `kubectl` to apply the `feature.yaml` file to the cluster:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f feature.yaml
----
