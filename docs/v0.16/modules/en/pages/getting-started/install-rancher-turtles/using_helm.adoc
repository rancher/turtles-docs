= Via Helm install

[CAUTION]
====
In case you need to review the list of prerequisites (including `cert-manager`), you can refer to xref:../index.adoc#_prerequisites[this table].
====


If you want to manually apply the Helm chart and be in full control of the installation.

The Cluster API Operator is required for installing {product_name} and will be installed as dependency of the {product_name} Helm chart.

CAPI Operator allows handling the lifecycle of Cluster API Providers using a declarative approach, extending the capabilities of `clusterctl`. If you want to learn more about it, you can refer to https://cluster-api-operator.sigs.k8s.io/[Cluster API Operator book].

[CAUTION]
====
Rancher's `embedded-cluster-api` functionality will be disabled when installing {product_name}. This includes also cleaning up Rancher-specific webhooks that otherwise would conflict with CAPI ones.

The recommended way to disable this feature and the Rancher-specific webhooks, is to use the official {product_name} Helm chart, that includes a `pre-install` hook to apply the following changes:  

* Disable the `embedded-cluster-api` feature in Rancher.
* Delete the `mutating-webhook-configuration` and `validating-webhook-configuration` webhooks that are no longer needed.
====


If you would like to understand how {product_name} works and what the architecture looks like, you can refer to the xref:../../reference-guides/architecture/intro.adoc[Architecture] section.

[NOTE]
====
If uninstalling, you can refer to xref:../getting-started/uninstall_turtles.adoc[Uninstalling {product_name}]

== Install {product_name} with `Cluster API Operator` as a Helm dependency

The `rancher-turtles` chart is available in https://rancher.github.io/turtles and this Helm repository must be added before proceeding with the installation:

[source,bash]
----
helm repo add turtles https://rancher.github.io/turtles
helm repo update
----

As mentioned before, installing {product_name} requires the https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-operator[Cluster API Operator] and the Helm chart can handle its installation automatically with a minimum set of flags:

[source,bash]
----
helm install rancher-turtles turtles/rancher-turtles --version v0.13.0 \
    -n rancher-turtles-system \
    --dependency-update \
    --create-namespace --wait \
    --timeout 180s
----

This operation could take a few minutes and, after installing, you can take some time to study the installed controllers, including:

* `rancher-turtles-controller`.
* `capi-operator`.

[NOTE]
====

* For a list of {product_name} versions, refer to https://github.com/rancher/turtles/releases[Releases page].
====


This is the basic, recommended configuration, which manages the creation of a secret containing the required CAPI feature flags (`CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY`, `EXP_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SET` and `EXP_MACHINE_POOL` enabled) in the core provider namespace. These feature flags are required to enable additional Cluster API functionality.

If you need to override the default behavior and use an existing secret (or add custom environment variables), you can pass the secret name helm flag. In this case, as a user, you are in charge of managing the secret creation and its content, including the minimum required features: `CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY`, `EXP_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SET` and `EXP_MACHINE_POOL` enabled.

[source,bash]
----
helm install ...
    # Passing secret name and namespace for additional environment variables
    --set cluster-api-operator.cluster-api.configSecret.name=<secret_name>
----

The following is an example of a user-managed secret `cluster-api-operator.cluster-api.configSecret.name=variables` with `CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY`, `EXP_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SET` and `EXP_MACHINE_POOL` feature flags set and an extra custom variable:

.secret.yaml
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: variables
  namespace: rancher-turtles-system
type: Opaque
stringData:
  CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY: "true"
  EXP_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SET: "true"
  EXP_MACHINE_POOL: "true"
  CUSTOM_ENV_VAR: "false"
----
