= Create & import your first cluster using Fleet

This section will guide you through creating your first cluster and importing it into Rancher Manager using a GitOps workflow with Fleet.

== Prerequisites

* Rancher Manager cluster with {product_name} installed
* Cluster API providers installed for your scenario - we'll be using the https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/tree/main/test/infrastructure/docker[Docker infrastructure] and https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/cluster-api-provider-rke2[RKE2 bootstrap/control plane] providers in these instructions - see xref:../../tasks/capi-operator/capiprovider_resource.adoc[Initialization for common providers using Turtles' `CAPIProvider`]

== Create your cluster definition

The **envsubst** can be used to generate the YAML for a cluster from a template, and substitute environment variables.

You can craft the YAML for your cluster manually. If you decide to do this then you can use the **templates** that infrastructure providers publish as part of their releases. For example, the AWS provider https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-aws/releases/tag/v2.2.1[publishes files] prefixed with **cluster-template** that can be used as a base. You will need to replace any tokens yourself or by using clusterctl (e.g. `curl -s https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-aws/releases/download/v2.2.1/cluster-template-eks.yaml | envsubst > cluster.yaml`).

[TIP]
====
To maintain proper resource management and avoid accidental deletion of custom resources managed outside of Helm during Helm operations, include the `helm.sh/resource-policy": keep` annotation in the top-level CAPI kinds within your cluster manifests.
====


[NOTE]
====
This guide does not use ClusterClass. Templates that use ClusterClass will require that the experimental feature be enabled.
====


To generate the YAML for the cluster do the following (assuming the Docker infrastructure provider is being used):

. Open a terminal and run the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
export CLUSTER_NAME=cluster1
export CONTROL_PLANE_MACHINE_COUNT=1
export WORKER_MACHINE_COUNT=1
export KUBERNETES_VERSION=v1.30.0
export NAMESPACE=default

# use the SHELL-FORMAT in envsubst to ensure we replace only the
# environment variables we exported above
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-turtles-fleet-example/templates/docker-rke2.yaml | envsubst '$CLUSTER_NAME,$CONTROL_PLANE_MACHINE_COUNT,$WORKER_MACHINE_COUNT,$KUBERNETES_VERSION,$NAMESPACE' > cluster1.yaml
----
+
. View *cluster1.yaml* to ensure there are no tokens. You can make any changes you want as well.

[TIP]
====
The Cluster API quickstart guide contains more detail. Read the steps related to this section https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/user/quick-start.html#required-configuration-for-common-providers[here].
====


== Create your repo for Fleet

. Create a new git repository (this guide uses GitHub)
. Create a new folder called *clusters*
. Move the *cluster1.yaml* file you generated in the last section to the *clusters* folder.
. Create a file called *fleet.yaml* in the root and add the following contents
+
[source,yaml]
----
namespace: default
----
+
. Commit the changes

[NOTE]
====
The *fleet.yaml* is used to specify configuration options for fleet (see https://fleet.rancher.io/ref-fleet-yaml[docs] for further details). In this instance its declaring that the cluster definitions should be added to the *default* namespace
====


After the described steps there will be a repository created structure similar to the example: [https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-turtles-fleet-example]

== Mark Namespace for auto-import

To automatically import a CAPI cluster into Rancher Manager there are 2 options:

. label a namespace so all clusters contained in it are imported.
. label an individual cluster definition so that it's imported.

In both cases the label is `cluster-api.cattle.io/rancher-auto-import`.

This walkthrough will use the first option of importing all clusters in a namespace.

. Open a terminal
. Label the default namespace in your Rancher Manager cluster:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl label namespace default cluster-api.cattle.io/rancher-auto-import=true
----

== Configure Rancher Manager

Now the cluster definitions are committed to a git repository they can be used to provision the clusters. To do this they will need to be imported into the Rancher Manager cluster (which is also acting as a Cluster API management cluster) using the *Continuous Delivery* feature (which uses Fleet).

There are 2 options to provide the configuration. The first is using the Rancher Manager UI and the second is by applying some YAML to your cluster. Both are covered below.

=== Using the Rancher Manager UI

. Go to Rancher Manager
. Select *Continuos Delivery* from the menu:
image:sidebar.png[sidebar]
. Select *fleet-local* as the namespace from the top right
image:ns.png[namespace]
. Select *Git Repos* from the sidebar
. Click *Add Repository*
. Enter *clusters* as the name
. Get the *HTTPS* clone URL from your git repo
image:gh_clone.png[git clone url]
. Add the URL into the *Repository URL* field
. Change the branch name to *main*
. Click *Next*
. Click *Create*
. Click on the *clusters* name
. Watch the resources become ready
. Select *Cluster Management* from the menu
. Check your cluster has been imported

=== Using kubectl

. Get the *HTTPS* clone URL from your git repo
. Create a new file called *repo.yaml*
. Add the following contents to the new file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: fleet.cattle.io/v1alpha1
kind: GitRepo
metadata:
  name: clusters
  namespace: fleet-local
spec:
  branch: main
  repo: <https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-turtles-fleet-example.git>
  targets: []
----
+
. Apply the file to the Rancher Manager cluster using *kubectl*:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f repo.yaml
----
+
. Go to Rancher Manager
. Select *Continuos Delivery* from the side bar
. Select *fleet-local* as the namespace from the top right
. Select *Git Repos* from the sidebar
. Click on the *clusters* name
. Watch the resources become ready
. Select *Cluster Management* from the menu
. Check your cluster has been imported
