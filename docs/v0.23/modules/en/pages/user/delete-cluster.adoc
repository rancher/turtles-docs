= Rancher Cluster Deletion

== Prerequisites

* A CAPI Cluster has been created and imported in Rancher as described in xref:tutorials/first-cluster.adoc#_provision_a_capi_workload_cluster[Provision a CAPI Workload Cluster].

== Delete the imported cluster from Rancher

1. From your browser, access Rancher Manager -> Cluster Management.
2. Locate the cluster to be deleted, click the three-dot menu (â‹®) next to it, and select Delete.
3. Once the imported cluster is marked for deletion:
    * Turtles controller will annotate the CAPI cluster with `imported: true`.
    * This annotation prevents the cluster from being re-imported automatically by Rancher.
    * Verify the annotation using the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n capi-clusters get clusters.cluster.x-k8s.io cluster1 -o json | jq .metadata.annotations
{
"imported": "true"
...
}
----

[NOTE]
Deleting the Rancher cluster only removes the `clusters.management.cattle.io` resource and disables auto-import for the associated CAPI cluster. The underlying CAPI cluster iteself remains intact.

== Re-import cluster

If you need to re-import the same CAPI cluster into Rancher:

Remove the `imported: true` annotation:
[source, bash]
----
kubectl -n capi-clusters patch clusters.cluster.x-k8s.io <cluster-name> --type='json' -p='[{"op": "remove", "path": "/metadata/annotations/imported"}]'
