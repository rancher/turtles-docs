= Create a cluster using Fleet

This section will guide you through creating a cluster that utilizes ClusterClass using a GitOps workflow with Fleet.

[NOTE]
====
This guide uses the https://github.com/rancher/turtles/tree/main/examples[examples repository].
====

== Prerequisites

* Rancher Manager cluster with {product_name} installed
* Cluster API providers installed for your scenario - we'll be using the https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/tree/main/test/infrastructure/docker[Docker infrastructure] and https://github.com/rancher/cluster-api-provider-rke2[RKE2 bootstrap/control plane] providers in these instructions - see xref:../reference/capiprovider.adoc[Initialization for common providers using Turtles' `CAPIProvider`]

== Configure Rancher Manager

*Configure your Fleet repository*

To simplify the process of cluster provisioning, we will be using a series of pre-configured examples that you can find in the repository https://github.com/rancher/turtles/tree/main/examples.
By inspecting the contents of this repository, you will find:

. An *applications* folder for additional apps that can be deployed using Fleet (CNI, CSI, CPI).
. A *clusterclasses* folder with a bunch of ClusterClass examples.
. A *clusters/docker/rke2* folder with an example of Docker cluster definition.

[NOTE]
If you prefer, you can create your own Fleet repository using the same base structure.

The cluster definitions will be imported into the Rancher Manager cluster (which is also acting as a Cluster API management cluster) using the *Continuous Delivery* feature (which uses Fleet).

There are 2 options to provide the configuration. The first is using the Rancher Manager UI and the second is by applying some YAML to your cluster. Both are covered below.

=== Import Cluster and ClusterClass Definitions

[tabs]
======
Using the Rancher Manager UI::

. Go to Rancher Manager
. Select *Continuous Delivery* from the menu:
image:sidebar.png[sidebar]
. Select *fleet-local* as the namespace from the top right
image:ns.png[namespace]
. Select *Git Repos* from the sidebar
. Click *Add Repository*
. Enter *clusters* as the name
. Get the *HTTPS* clone URL from your git repo
image:gh_clone.png[git clone url]
. Add the URL into the *Repository URL* field
. Change the branch name to *main*
. Add the following paths to specify which directories to deploy:

+
----
examples/clusterclasses/docker/rke2
examples/applications/cni/calico
examples/applications/lb/docker
examples/clusters/docker/rke2
----
. Click *Next*
. Click *Create*
. Click on the *clusters* name
. Watch the resources become ready
. Select *Cluster Management* from the menu
. Check your cluster has been imported

Manually using kubectl::

. Get the *HTTPS* clone URL from your git repo
. Create a new file called *repo.yaml*
. Add the following contents to the new file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: fleet.cattle.io/v1alpha1
kind: GitRepo
metadata:
  name: clusters
  namespace: fleet-local
spec:
  branch: main
  repo: https://github.com/rancher/turtles.git
  paths:
    - examples/clusterclasses/docker/rke2
    - examples/applications/cni/calico
    - examples/applications/lb/docker
    - examples/clusters/docker/rke2
  targets: []
----
+
. Apply the file to the Rancher Manager cluster using *kubectl*:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f repo.yaml
----
+
. Go to Rancher Manager
. Select *Continuous Delivery* from the sidebar
. Select *fleet-local* as the namespace from the top right
. Select *Git Repos* from the sidebar
. Click on the *clusters* name
. Watch the resources become ready
. Select *Cluster Management* from the menu
. Check your cluster has been imported
