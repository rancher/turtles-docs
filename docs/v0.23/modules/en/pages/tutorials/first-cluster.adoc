= Create & Import Your First Cluster

This section will guide you through creating your first cluster and importing it into Rancher Manager. Two alternative methods for cluster provisioning are presented: **using a GitOps workflow with Fleet** and **manually applying the manifests via `kubectl`**.

== Prerequisites

* Rancher Manager cluster with {product_name} installed
* Cluster API providers installed for your scenario - we'll be using the https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/tree/main/test/infrastructure/docker[Docker infrastructure] and https://github.com/rancher/cluster-api-provider-rke2[RKE2 bootstrap/control plane] providers in these instructions - see xref:../reference/capiprovider.adoc[Initialization for common providers using Turtles' `CAPIProvider`]

== Provision a CAPI Workload Cluster

GitOps using Fleet::

====
*Configure your Fleet repository*

To simplify the process of cluster provisioning, we will be using a series of pre-configured examples that you can find in the repository https://github.com/rancher/turtles/tree/main/examples.
By inspecting the contents of this repository, you will find:

. An *applications* folder for additional apps that can be deployed using Fleet (CNI, CSI, CPI).
. A *clusterclasses* folder with a bunch of ClusterClass examples.
. A *clusters/docker/rke2* folder with an example of Docker cluster definition.

[NOTE]
If you prefer, you can create your own Fleet repository using the same base structure.

*Use Rancher UI to add your Fleet repository*

Now the cluster definitions are committed to a git repository they can be used to provision the clusters. To do this they will need to be imported into the Rancher Manager cluster (which is also acting as a Cluster API management cluster) using the *Continuous Delivery* feature (which uses Fleet).

. Go to Rancher Manager
. Select *Continuous Delivery* from the menu:

. Select *fleet-local* as the namespace from the top right
image:ns.png[namespace]
. Select *Git Repos* from the sidebar
. Click *Add Repository*
. Enter *clusters* as the name
. Get the *HTTPS* clone URL from your git repo
image:gh_clone.png[git clone url]
. Add the URL into the *Repository URL* field
. Change the branch name to *main*
. Add the following paths to specify which directories to deploy:

examples/clusterclasses/docker/rke2
examples/applications/cni/calico
examples/applications/lb/docker
examples/clusters/docker/rke2
----
. Click *Next*
. Click *Create*
. Click on the *clusters* name
. Watch the resources become ready
. Select *Cluster Management* from the menu
. Check your cluster has been imported

Manually using kubectl::
+
====
*Apply the cluster resources*

To create the cluster using kubectl, run the following commands:

. Open a terminal and apply the ClusterClass and related templates:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/turtles/refs/heads/main/examples/clusterclasses/docker/rke2/clusterclass-docker-rke2.yaml
----

. Apply the load balancer configuration:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/turtles/refs/heads/main/examples/applications/lb/docker/configmap.yaml
----

. Apply the CNI (Calico) configuration:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/turtles/refs/heads/main/examples/applications/cni/calico/helm-chart.yaml
----

. Create the cluster:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/turtles/refs/heads/main/examples/clusters/docker/rke2/cluster.yaml
----

. Watch the resources become ready:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get clusters -w
----

. Select *Cluster Management* from the menu
. Check your cluster has been imported

== Mark Namespace for auto-import

To automatically import a CAPI cluster into Rancher Manager there are 2 options:

. Label a namespace so all clusters contained in it are imported.
. Label an individual cluster definition so that it's imported.

In both cases the label is `cluster-api.cattle.io/rancher-auto-import`.

[NOTE]
====
The example cluster we just created is already configured for auto-import, but this section shows you how to configure it manually for your own clusters.
====

This walkthrough will use the first option of importing all clusters in a namespace.

. Open a terminal
. Label the cluster's namespace in your Rancher Manager cluster:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl label namespace capi-clusters cluster-api.cattle.io/rancher-auto-import=true
----

[NOTE]
====
A namespace (or cluster) can be marked for auto-import at any time: before or after the cluster has been created.
====

[CAUTION]
====
Marking a cluster for auto-import triggers automatic registration by the Turtles controller, manual execution of
registration commands is not required.
====

[CAUTION]
====
To prevent a cluster from getting stuck in deletion when Fleet is removed, keep auto-import enabled in the UI or avoid manually removing labels in the cluster's namespace, as Turtles will no longer handle the 'import' functionality from that point onward.
