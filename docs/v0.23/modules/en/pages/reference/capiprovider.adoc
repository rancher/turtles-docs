= CAPI Provider

The `CAPIProvider` resource allows managing Cluster API Operator manifests in a declarative way. It is used to provision and configure Cluster API providers like AWS, vSphere etc.

`CAPIProvider` follows a GitOps model - the spec fields are declarative user inputs. The controller only updates status.

Every field provided by the upstream CAPI Operator `CAPIProviderSpec` resource is also available in the spec of the `CAPIProvider` resource. Feel free to refer to upstream configuration link:https://cluster-api-operator.sigs.k8s.io/03_topics/02_configuration/05_provider-spec-configuration[guides] for advanced scenarios.

All the xref:../overview/certified.adoc[certified] CAPI Providers are configured using an embedded configuration. In order to override it, a custom xref:./clusterctlconfig.adoc#_override_a_certified_provider_version[ClusterctlConfig] needs to be created.

== Usage

To use the `CAPIProvider` resource:

. Create a `CAPIProvider` resource with the desired provider name, type, credentials, configuration, and features.
. The `CAPIProvider` controller will handle templating the required Cluster API Operator manifests based on the `CAPIProvider` spec.
. The status field on the `CAPIProvider` resource will reflect the state of the generated manifests.
. Manage the `CAPIProvider` object declaratively to apply changes to the generated provider manifests.

Here is an example `CAPIProvider` manifest:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: turtles-capi.cattle.io/v1alpha1
kind: CAPIProvider
metadata:
  name: aws-infra
  namespace: capi-providers
spec:
  name: aws
  type: infrastructure
  enableAutomaticUpdate: true
  credentials:
    rancherCloudCredential: aws-creds # Rancher credentials secret for AWS
  configSecret:
    name: aws-config
  features:
    clusterResourceSet: true
----

This will generate an AWS infrastructure provider with the supplied mapping for Rancher credential secret and custom enabled features.

The `CAPIProvider` controller will own all the generated provider resources, allowing garbage collection by deleting the `CAPIProvider` object.

== Specification

The key fields in the `CAPIProvider` spec are:

* `name` - Name of the provider (aws, vsphere etc). Inherited from `metadata.name` if not specified.
* `type` - Kind of provider resource (can be set to `core`, `controlPlane`, `bootstrap`, `infrastructure`, `addon`, `ipam` or `runtimeextension`).
* `credentials` - Source credentials for provider specification.
* `configSecret` - Name of the provider config secret, where the variables and synced credential will be stored. By default if not specified, will inherit the name of the `CAPIProvider` resource.
* `features` - Enabled provider features.
* `variables` - Variables is a map of environment variables to add to the content of the `configSecret`.
* `version` - Version indicates the provider version.
* `enableAutomaticUpdate` - Allow the provider to update automatically. Only enabled by default on Turtles chart installed providers.
* `fetchConfig` - FetchConfig determines how the operator will fetch the components and metadata for the provider.
** `oci` - OCI to be used for fetching the provider’s components and metadata from an OCI artifact. You must set `providerSpec.Version` field for operator to pick up desired version of the release from GitHub. If the providerSpec.Version is missing, latest provider version from clusterctl defaults is used.
** `selector` - Selector to be used for fetching provider’s components and metadata from ConfigMaps stored inside the cluster. Each ConfigMap is expected to contain components and metadata for a specific version only.
** `url` - URL to be used for fetching the provider’s components and metadata from a remote Github repository.

== Version pinning and automatic updates

The `CAPIProvider` `version` can be set at any time to pin the provider to a specific version.  +
Additionally, `automaticUpdates` can be toggled to allow automatic updates to the latest version available. The latest version available is determined by the embedded clusterctl configuration for xref:../overview/certified.adoc[certified] providers, and it can be overridden or configured for custom providers using xref:../reference/clusterctlconfig.adoc[ClusterctlConfig].

== Deletion

When a `CAPIProvider` resource is deleted, the Kubernetes garbage collection will clean up all the generated provider resources that it owns. This includes:

* Cluster API Operator resource instance
* Secret referenced by the `configSecret`
