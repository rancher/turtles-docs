= Manual Installation

This page describes how to install {product_name} manually, using the Helm CLI.

[CAUTION]
====
In case you need to review the list of prerequisites (including `cert-manager`), you can refer to xref:../tutorials/quickstart.adoc#_prerequisites[this table].
====

{product_name} uses the https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-operator[Cluster API Operator] to provide a declarative way of installing Cluster API Providers and managing their lifecycle. If you want to learn more about it, you can refer to the https://cluster-api-operator.sigs.k8s.io[Cluster API Operator book].

Since {product_name} depends on the Cluster API Operator functionality, it is installed as an embedded controller in {product_name} pod.

[CAUTION]
====
Rancher's `embedded-cluster-api` functionality will be disabled when installing {product_name}. This includes also cleaning up Rancher-specific webhooks that otherwise would conflict with CAPI ones.

The recommended way to disable this feature and the Rancher-specific webhooks, is to use the official {product_name} Helm chart, that includes a `pre-install` hook to apply the following changes:  

* Disable the `embedded-cluster-api` feature in Rancher.
* Delete the `mutating-webhook-configuration` and `validating-webhook-configuration` webhooks that are no longer needed.

If you would like to understand how {product_name} works and what the architecture looks like, you can refer to the xref:../overview/architecture.adoc[Architecture] section.

== Install {product_name} using Helm

The `rancher-turtles` Helm chart is available in https://rancher.github.io/turtles and this Helm repository must be added before proceeding with the installation:

[source,bash]
----
helm repo add turtles https://rancher.github.io/turtles
helm repo update
----

Once the Helm repository has been added and updated locally, you can proceed to install {product_name}. The Helm chart will handle installation of any dependencies automatically:

[source,bash]
----
helm install rancher-turtles turtles/rancher-turtles --version v0.23.0 \
    -n rancher-turtles-system \
    --dependency-update \
    --create-namespace --wait \
    --timeout 180s
----

The installation process may take a few minutes. Once complete, you can take some time to review the installed controllers:

* `rancher-turtles` with embedded `cluster-api-operator` controller.
* `cluster-api` controller.
* `cluster-api-addon-provider-fleet` controller.
* `rke2-bootstrap` controller.
* `rke2-control-plane` controller.

By default, the installation process will create a secret named `capi-env-variables` in the core provider namespace, which is used to enable certain Cluster API feature flags (`CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY`, `EXP_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SET` and `EXP_MACHINE_POOL`). These feature flags are required to enable additional Cluster API functionality.

If you need to override the default behavior and use an existing secret (or add custom environment variables), you can pass the secret name via a Helm flag, as shown in the example below. In this case, you are responsible for managing the secret creation and its contents, so make sure to include the feature flags (`CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY`, `EXP_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SET` and `EXP_MACHINE_POOL`) as enabled.

[source,bash]
----
helm install ...
    # Passing secret name and namespace for additional environment variables
    --set cluster-api-operator.cluster-api.configSecret.name=<secret_name>
----

The following is an example of a user-managed secret `cluster-api-operator.cluster-api.configSecret.name=variables` with `CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY`, `EXP_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SET` and `EXP_MACHINE_POOL` feature flags set and an extra custom variable:

.secret.yaml
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: variables
  namespace: rancher-turtles-system
type: Opaque
stringData:
  CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY: "true"
  EXP_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SET: "true"
  EXP_MACHINE_POOL: "true"
  CUSTOM_ENV_VAR: "false"
----
